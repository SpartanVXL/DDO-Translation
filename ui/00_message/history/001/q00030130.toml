 Acre Selund's Liberation Army, as well
as our arisen have　successfully infiltrated
Lookout Castle, and defeated the enemy
commander occupying it.
 The Liberation Army moved their base
from the fort they had been in to Lookout
Castle, and now have their sights on the
Capital City Megado.
 Naturally, the ones in the Liberation Army
who support the royal family are elated with
the reclamation of Lookout Castle, and I
hear they are currently celebrating.
 I wish for them to celebrate and rest
to their hearts content. The fight the
free Acre Selund from evil still continues.'''
